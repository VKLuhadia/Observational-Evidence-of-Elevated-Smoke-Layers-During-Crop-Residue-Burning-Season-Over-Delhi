# Observational-Evidence-of-Elevated-Smoke-Layers-During-Crop-Residue-Burning-Season-Over-Delhi

 Post-monsoon crop residue burning (CRB) in Punjab-Haryana injects large smoke plumes into the
 atmosphere.
 Delhi (200–300 km downwind) records higher PM2.5 than source region during these events.
 This project builds a synthetic, quantitative image-processing pipeline that mimics satellite AOD/AAOD
 maps, vertical lidar-style curtains, radiosonde temperature profiles, and reanalysis-style aerosol layers.
 Every step uses Digital Image Processing (DIP) operations: smoothing, contrast stretching, gradients,
 thresholding, interpolation, and edge detection.
